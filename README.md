### Note: ###
> * All of these technologies/frameworks/languages are new to me, except Flutter. I am trying to learn Full Stack development in Flutter where the power of Flutter can be utilized for beautiful UI and cross-platform compatibility(though you can not see this in this app as I'm learning at the momentðŸ˜…) and create a custom backend which gives us more power and flexibility rather than already available solutions.
> * You may see some delay in the latest commits because I'm a slow learner and get distracted easily, but I will try my best to complete the app and also upload the apk in this repository in future commits.
> * If you have any suggestions like any improvements for learning then you can contact me on [Link tree](https://linktr.ee/umang2510).
